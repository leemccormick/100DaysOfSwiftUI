It’s much better to terminate immediately and give us a clear explanation of what went wrong so we can correct the problem, and that’s exactly what fatalError() does.

/* Project 5, part 2
 Now that you understand the techniques necessary for this project, today we’ll be implementing our game. Yes, there will be a fair chunk of practice here, and yes, hopefully this will be an easy project for you. But that shouldn’t stop you from tackling it with gusto – give it your best shot!
 
 Try to keep in mind some famous words from the American writer and lecturer Dale Carnegie:
 
 “Don’t be afraid to give your best to what seemingly are small jobs. Every time you conquer one it makes you strong – if you do the little jobs well, the big ones will tend to care of themselves.”
 
 Working with lists, arrays, text fields and more should definitely be little jobs for you by now, but one of the goals of this course is to give you a truly rock solid foundations in those fundamentals, backed up by a knowledge of what greater things are also possible.
 
 In the future I want you to be able to look at a sketch of an app idea and know exactly how to build it before you’ve even written a line of code, because ultimately it can be broken down into a series of little jobs.
 
 And if you still find it too easy, relax: tomorrow is the challenge day!
 
 Today you have three topics to work through, and you’ll put into practice everything you learned about List, UITextChecker, and more.
 
 Adding to a list of words
 Running code when our app launches
 Validating words with UITextChecker
 
 */

/* Adding to a list of words
 The user interface for this app will be made up of three main SwiftUI views: a NavigationView showing the word they are spelling from, a TextField where they can enter one answer, and a List showing all the words they have entered previously.
 
 For now, every time users enter a word into the text field, we’ll automatically add it to the list of used words. Later, though, we’ll add some validation to make sure the word hasn’t been used before, can actually be produced from the root word they’ve been given, and is a real word and not just some random letters.
 
 Let’s start with the basics: we need an array of words they have already used, a root word for them to spell other words from, and a string we can bind to a text field. So, add these three properties to ContentView now:
 
 @State private var usedWords = [String]()
 @State private var rootWord = ""
 @State private var newWord = ""
 As for the body of the view, we’re going to start off as simple as possible: a NavigationView with rootWord for its title, then a couple of sections inside a list:
 
 var body: some View {
 NavigationView {
 List {
 Section {
 TextField("Enter your word", text: $newWord)
 }
 
 Section {
 ForEach(usedWords, id: \.self) { word in
 Text(word)
 }
 }
 }
 .navigationTitle(rootWord)
 }
 }
 Note: Using id: \.self would cause problems if there were lots of duplicates in usedWords, but soon enough we’ll be disallowing that so it’s not a problem.
 
 Now, our text view has a problem: although we can type into the text box, we can’t submit anything from there – there’s no way of adding our entry to the list of used words.
 
 To fix that we’re going to write a new method called addNewWord() that will:
 
 Lowercase newWord and remove any whitespace
 Check that it has at least 1 character otherwise exit
 Insert that word at position 0 in the usedWords array
 Set newWord back to be an empty string
 Later on we’ll add some extra validation between steps 2 and 3 to make sure the word is allowable, but for now this method is straightforward:
 
 func addNewWord() {
 // lowercase and trim the word, to make sure we don't add duplicate words with case differences
 let answer = newWord.lowercased().trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespacesAndNewlines)
 
 // exit if the remaining string is empty
 guard answer.count > 0 else { return }
 
 // extra validation to come
 
 usedWords.insert(answer, at: 0)
 newWord = ""
 }
 We want to call addNewWord() when the user presses return on the keyboard, and in SwiftUI we can do that by adding an onSubmit() modifier somewhere in our view hierarchy – it could be directly on the button, but it can be anywhere else in the view because it will be triggered when any text is submitted.
 
 onSubmit() needs to be given a function that accepts no parameters and returns nothing, which exactly matches the addNewWord() method we just wrote. So, we can pass that in directly by adding this modifier below navigationTitle():
 
 .onSubmit(addNewWord)
 Run the app now and you’ll see that things are starting to come together already: we can now type words into the text field, press return, and see them appear in the list.
 
 Inside addNewWord() we used usedWords.insert(answer, at: 0) for a reason: if we had used append(answer) the new words would have appeared at the end of the list where they would probably be off screen, but by inserting words at the start of the array they automatically appear at the top of the list – much better.
 
 Before we put a title up in the navigation view, I’m going to make two small changes to our layout.
 
 First, when we call addNewWord() it lowercases the word the user entered, which is helpful because it means the user can’t add “car”, “Car”, and “CAR”. However, it looks odd in practice: the text field automatically capitalizes the first letter of whatever the user types, so when they submit “Car” what they see in the list is “car”.
 
 To fix this, we can disable capitalization for the text field with another modifier: autocapitalization(). Please add this to the text field now:
 
 .autocapitalization(.none)
 The second thing we’ll change, just because we can, is to use Apple’s SF Symbols icons to show the length of each word next to the text. SF Symbols provides numbers in circles from 0 through 50, all named using the format “x.circle.fill” – so 1.circle.fill, 20.circle.fill.
 
 In this program we’ll be showing eight-letter words to users, so if they rearrange all those letters to make a new word the longest it will be is also eight letters. As a result, we can use those SF Symbols number circles just fine – we know that all possible word lengths are covered.
 
 So, we can wrap our word text in a HStack, and place an SF Symbol next to it using Image(systemName:)` like this:
 
 ForEach(usedWords, id: \.self) { word in
 HStack {
 Image(systemName: "\(word.count).circle")
 Text(word)
 }
 }
 If you run the app now you’ll see you can type words in the text field, press return, then see them appear in the list with their length icon to the side. Nice!
 
 Now, if you wanted to we could add one sneaky little extra tweak in here. When we submit our text field right now, the text just appears in the list immediately, but we could animate that by modifying the insert() call inside addNewWord() to this:
 
 withAnimation {
 usedWords.insert(answer, at: 0)
 }
 We haven’t looked at animations just yet, and we’re going to look at them much more shortly, but that change alone will make our new words slide in much more nicely – I think it’s a big improvement!
 */

/* Running code when our app launches
 When Xcode builds an iOS project, it puts your compiled program, your asset catalog, and any other assets into a single directory called a bundle, then gives that bundle the name YourAppName.app. This “.app” extension is automatically recognized by iOS and Apple’s other platforms, which is why if you double-click something like Notes.app on macOS it knows to launch the program inside the bundle.
 
 In our game, we’re going to include a file called “start.txt”, which includes over 10,000 eight-letter words that will be randomly selected for the player to work with. This was included in the files for this project that you should have downloaded from GitHub, so please drag start.txt into your project now.
 
 We already defined a property called rootWord, which will contain the word we want the player to spell from. What we need to do now is write a new method called startGame() that will:
 
 Find start.txt in our bundle
 Load it into a string
 Split that string into array of strings, with each element being one word
 Pick one random word from there to be assigned to rootWord, or use a sensible default if the array is empty.
 Each of those four tasks corresponds to one line of code, but there’s a twist: what if we can’t locate start.txt in our app bundle, or if we can locate it but we can’t load it? In that case we have a serious problem, because our app is really broken – either we forgot to include the file somehow (in which case our game won’t work), or we included it but for some reason iOS refused to let us read it (in which case our game won’t work, and our app is broken).
 
 Regardless of what caused it, this is a situation that never ought to happen, and Swift gives us a function called fatalError() that lets us respond to unresolvable problems really clearly. When we call fatalError() it will – unconditionally and always – cause our app to crash. It will just die. Not “might die” or “maybe die”: it will always just terminate straight away.
 
 I realize that sounds bad, but what it lets us do is important: for problems like this one, such as if we forget to include a file in our project, there is no point trying to make our app struggle on in a broken state. It’s much better to terminate immediately and give us a clear explanation of what went wrong so we can correct the problem, and that’s exactly what fatalError() does.
 
 Anyway, let’s take a look at the code – I’ve added comments matching the numbers above:
 
 func startGame() {
 // 1. Find the URL for start.txt in our app bundle
 if let startWordsURL = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "start", withExtension: "txt") {
 // 2. Load start.txt into a string
 if let startWords = try? String(contentsOf: startWordsURL) {
 // 3. Split the string up into an array of strings, splitting on line breaks
 let allWords = startWords.components(separatedBy: "\n")
 
 // 4. Pick one random word, or use "silkworm" as a sensible default
 rootWord = allWords.randomElement() ?? "silkworm"
 
 // If we are here everything has worked, so we can exit
 return
 }
 }
 
 // If were are *here* then there was a problem – trigger a crash and report the error
 fatalError("Could not load start.txt from bundle.")
 }
 Now that we have a method to load everything for the game, we need to actually call that thing when our view is shown. SwiftUI gives us a dedicated view modifier for running a closure when a view is shown, so we can use that to call startGame() and get things moving – add this modifier after onSubmit():
 
 .onAppear(perform: startGame)
 If you run the game now you should see a random eight-letter word at the top of the navigation view. It doesn’t really mean anything yet, because players can still enter whatever words they want. Let’s fix that next…
 */

/* Validating words with UITextChecker
 Now that our game is all set up, the last part of this project is to make sure the user can’t enter invalid words. We’re going to implement this as four small methods, each of which perform exactly one check: is the word original (it hasn’t been used already), is the word possible (they aren’t trying to spell “car” from “silkworm”), and is the word real (it’s an actual English word).
 
 If you were paying attention you’ll have noticed that was only three methods – that’s because the fourth method will be there to make showing error messages easier.
 
 Anyway, let’s start with the first method: this will accept a string as its only parameter, and return true or false depending on whether the word has been used before or not. We already have a usedWords array, so we can pass the word into its contains() method and send the result back like this:
 
 func isOriginal(word: String) -> Bool {
 !usedWords.contains(word)
 }
 That’s one method down!
 
 The next one is slightly trickier: how can we check whether a random word can be made out of the letters from another random word?
 
 There are a couple of ways we could tackle this, but the easiest one is this: if we create a variable copy of the root word, we can then loop over each letter of the user’s input word to see if that letter exists in our copy. If it does, we remove it from the copy (so it can’t be used twice), then continue. If we make it to the end of the user’s word successfully then the word is good, otherwise there’s a mistake and we return false.
 
 So, here’s our second method:
 
 func isPossible(word: String) -> Bool {
 var tempWord = rootWord
 
 for letter in word {
 if let pos = tempWord.firstIndex(of: letter) {
 tempWord.remove(at: pos)
 } else {
 return false
 }
 }
 
 return true
 }
 The final method is harder, because we need to use UITextChecker from UIKit. In order to bridge Swift strings to Objective-C strings safely, we need to create an instance of NSRange using the UTF-16 count of our Swift string. This isn’t nice, I know, but I’m afraid it’s unavoidable until Apple cleans up these APIs.
 
 So, our last method will make an instance of UITextChecker, which is responsible for scanning strings for misspelled words. We’ll then create an NSRange to scan the entire length of our string, then call rangeOfMisspelledWord() on our text checker so that it looks for wrong words. When that finishes we’ll get back another NSRange telling us where the misspelled word was found, but if the word was OK the location for that range will be the special value NSNotFound.
 
 So, here’s our final method:
 
 func isReal(word: String) -> Bool {
 let checker = UITextChecker()
 let range = NSRange(location: 0, length: word.utf16.count)
 let misspelledRange = checker.rangeOfMisspelledWord(in: word, range: range, startingAt: 0, wrap: false, language: "en")
 
 return misspelledRange.location == NSNotFound
 }
 Before we can use those three, I want to add some code to make showing error alerts easier. First, we need some properties to control our alerts:
 
 @State private var errorTitle = ""
 @State private var errorMessage = ""
 @State private var showingError = false
 Now we can add a method that sets the title and message based on the parameters it receives, then flips the showingError Boolean to true:
 
 func wordError(title: String, message: String) {
 errorTitle = title
 errorMessage = message
 showingError = true
 }
 We can then pass those directly on to SwiftUI by adding an alert() modifier below .onAppear():
 
 .alert(errorTitle, isPresented: $showingError) {
 Button("OK", role: .cancel) { }
 } message: {
 Text(errorMessage)
 }
 We’ve done that several times now, so hopefully it’s becoming second nature!
 
 At long last it’s time to finish our game: replace the // extra validation to come comment in addNewWord() with this:
 
 guard isOriginal(word: answer) else {
 wordError(title: "Word used already", message: "Be more original")
 return
 }
 
 guard isPossible(word: answer) else {
 wordError(title: "Word not possible", message: "You can't spell that word from '\(rootWord)'!")
 return
 }
 
 guard isReal(word: answer) else {
 wordError(title: "Word not recognized", message: "You can't just make them up, you know!")
 return
 }
 If you run the app now you should find that it will refuse to let you use words if they fail our tests – trying a duplicate word won’t work, words that can’t be spelled from the root word won’t work, and gibberish words won’t work either.
 
 That’s another app done – good job!
