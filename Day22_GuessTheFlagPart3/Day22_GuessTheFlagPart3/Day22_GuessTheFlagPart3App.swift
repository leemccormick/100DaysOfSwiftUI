/*
 In this project you’ve learned about images, stacks, gradients, buttons, and more, along with a whole host of new modifiers to help bring your UI designs to life.

 All of these skills will come in useful in your own SwiftUI apps – not maybe or might, but will. As Dr Seuss said, “the more that you read, the more things you will know; the more that you learn, the more places you'll go.” And that’s what this course is about: giving you the ability to go anywhere with SwiftUI, and build whatever apps help you reach your goals.

 Before we move on to the next topic, it’s time to pause and review: did you fully understand everything you learned? That means another test, but it also means three more coding challenges to make sure you’re writing your own code as often as possible.

 Today you should work through the wrap up chapter for project 2, complete its review, then work through all three of its challenges.

 Guess the Flag: Wrap up
 Review for Project 2: Guess the Flag
 Once you’re done, tell other people: you’ve completed your second SwiftUI project, you’ve passed the test, and you’ve even extended it with your own code.

 You should be proud of what you’ve accomplished – good job!
